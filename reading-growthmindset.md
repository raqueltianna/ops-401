## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice
- The main thing I got from this article is deliberate practice, that you have to push yourself out of your comfort zone by always challenging yourself. With deliberate practice it's not really leading to enhancing your skills but about pushing yourself, repeating it often, and then getting feedback.  Recently I had did a lot of research on how I could expand my knowledge beyond class and saw a lot of self projects that I could do that would help me further my knowledge in coding, networking, etc. So I liked that the article listed a few examples of some challenges that people could use to learn and practice. Overall I think the main point is to get out of rountine and continuously challenge yourself to further your skills/

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset 
- The main thing that I got from this is mostly the differencew between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset and how they impact how someone develops. I feel she also emphasized about how it's import to praise effort and the work that someone puts instead of just praising intelligence. I think one of the most important thing she said is that it is important to encourage challenges as growth rather than failure. 

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
- The main thing that I got from this video was that grit is the paassion and perseverance for long term goals and that often grit passes factors that we feel often play a role in our life, looks, intelligence, etc. She also emphasized the growth mindset like Carol Dweck did which I think once again emphasizes the importance of the growth mindset. 

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success
- Out of all the videos in this assignment this one resonated me the most. He emphasized the importance of personal success rather than societal expectations or definitions of success. I feel that often I gage my level of success based on what other people or society see as being successful and not really sitting down and thinking about how much I have accomplished at my young age more than a lot of other people have done or seen in their entire lives. So I think his message about questioning sociteal notions and making your personal idealogy on what success really is. 

## Emotional Intelligence
- Self-Awareness: 29
- Self-Management: 20
- Social Awareness: 18
- Relationship Management: 18
- The results of this was not really a surprise to me. I feel like I am very aware of my emotional intelligence because journaling, meditation, and reflection is a part of my daily routine. I feel like it is important to be aware of things like this because everyday we have to deal with people, their emotions, and our own. I use to be very reactive when it came to my feelings a few years ago and that's when I decided to become more aware of that and I have changed accordingly. 

## Your Biases 
- My strongest areas: Empathy and Curiosity; Meaningful Connections
- My weakest areas: Four Ways to Act 
- Area of Focus: Four Ways to Act
- I wasn't surprised that Empathy and Curosity and Meaningful Connections were my strongest areas because knowing how it feels to feel excluded, it's important to me that I make sure that people always feel heard or that someone cares especially in this day and age of the lonely epidemic you just don't know what people are going through so it is important to make connections with people. The reason why my Four Ways to act was the weakest area is mostly because I don't always prioritize myself when it comes to work and my personal life and self care.
