### List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS? 
- A firewall is more for prevention and blocking while an IDS is more for detection. 
-  IDS are situated on the internal network while firewalls are situated on the network perimeter. 
### Under what circumstances would you choose a network based IDS over a host based IDS? 
- You would choose a NIDS over a HIDS if you wanted to monitor network traffic over multiple host like an organization. You would want to do HIDS if you need to focus on the security of individual host. 
### Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS? 
- An experienced engineer is needed to administer them.
- False positives are frequent. 
- They are not self sufficient and will not prevent incidents by themselves. 
## Things I Want to Know More About
- I think I would just like to see how IDS/IPS are implemented.
