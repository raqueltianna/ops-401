### What is the main goal of Threat Hunting and how is it different from traditional threat monitoring?
- The main goal of Threat Hunting is to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats. It is different from traditional threat monitoring by actively searching instead of the passively observing network traffic. 

### What are the four types of YARA rules and what does each one of them use to identify and classify malicious software?
- String based rules that uses specific strings or sequences of characters to identify malware. 
- File metadata-based rules which uses metadata about the file being analyzed to identify malware. 
- Hash-based rules which utilizes cryptographic hashes to identify malware. They can be used to detect malware that has been modified or disguised in an attempt to evade detection. 
- Network-based rules which uses network traffic data to identify malware. They can be used to detect malware that is communicating with a specific IP address or port 

### How are YARA rules similar to how Anti-Virus programs detect malicious software?
- YARA rules are similar to Anti-Virus programs because they both detect malicious software by comparing observed data against predefined patterns associated with malware. Both are used to identify and classify threats.
