### How are Threat Hunting and Pen-testing different?
- Threat Hunting is actively searching for signs of malicious activity and aiming to detect threats while penetration testing is simulating a cyberattack on a system to evaluate how secure it is and finding possible vulnerabilities. 
### What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
- The primary objective of Threat Hunting is identifying and mitigating threats that are potentially within the organization's network.
### Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
- To advocate for security organization I would say that it is important that we have proactive threat detection instead of just being reactive. I would also say stress the fact that implementing Threat Hunting would help reduce time and the impact of possible breaches and just overall improving security posture and reducing risk.
