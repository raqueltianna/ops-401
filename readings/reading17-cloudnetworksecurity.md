### What are some of the key features of the VPC model? 
- Some of the key features of the VPC model are: 
    - Agility: This allows you to adjust the size of your resources (virtual network and cloud resources) in real time 
    - Availability: Redundant resources and highly fault tolerant availability zone architectures are utilized to ensure that applications and workloads remain consistently available. 
    - Security: Data and applications are segregated from customers of the provider, allowing you to have full control over how resources are are accessed and who is able to access them. 
    - Affordability: Users are able to save money in public cloud services and come out saving on hardware, labor, etc. 

### What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model? 
- The three tiers are:
    - The web or presentation tier, which takes requests from web browsers and presents information created by, or stored within, the other layers to end users.
    - The application tier, which houses the business logic and is where most processing takes place. 
    - The database tier, comprised of database servers that store the data processed in the application tier. 

### Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job. 
- A VPC is like a specialized hospital section for your digital data and applications. Just like how a ICU patient and a surgical patient wouldn't be on the same section, a VPC makes sure that your data doesn't mix with other's data in the cloud. As the "nurse in charge" you have full control over who gets access to your section just like you can with your VPC. With a VPN it is like a hallway that connects different sections of the hospital which helps safely transfer patient from a hospital room to the main hospital section like a VPN lets you transfer data from your computer to a data center safely. To summarize that all up a VPC is like a private section in a hospital and a VPN is like a hallway connecting different parts of the hospital.
