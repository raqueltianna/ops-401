### From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.
- Some examples of data at rest in my day to day computer use is that I have Outlook on my email. The emails that are in my inbox or archived are all data at rest. Another example is the external hard drive that I have that is only accessed when I'm playing certain games on my computer so it is another example of data at rest. 
- Some examples of data in transit on my day to day computer is when we have to download files for class assignments from the internet, the file is in transit from the server to my downloads folder. I am also a frequent Amazon shopper and when I am purchasing online my credit card information is in transit from my computer to Amazon's server.

- Data encryption ensures confidentiality. It makes sure that information isn't accessed by unauthorized people which also plays into the integrity and availability components of the CIA triad as well. 

## Things I want to know more about
