### Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
- A sniffing attack is pretty much eavesdropping on a conversation over a network. It's like talking to someone on a landline and your parent picks up another receiver in the house and can hear your entire conversation. In sniffing, the attacker intercepts digital messages traveling across the internet. 
### What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
- Passive sniffing: This one is more like silently listening and not participating in the conversation. A pro of this is that it's stealthy and harder to detect but a con is that it doesn't allow for modification of messages. 
- Active Sniffing (ARP Spoofing): This one is more like pretending to be someone else to trick the other participant. A pro of this is that allows for manipulation of messages and a con is that it more easily detected and requires more effort. 
### How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
- Encryption scrambles data into a format that is unreadable without the decryption key. If it is intercepted by a sniffer it appears unreadable without the decryption key. This protects information from being stolen by an attacker during transmission.
