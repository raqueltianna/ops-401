# Reading 09: Public Key Infrastructure 

### Article Links
- [What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)](https://www.ssh.com/pki/)

### Name the three main components which make up PKI.
- The three main components are public key certificate, public and private key pair, and certificate authority. 
### How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
- PKI is like a medical ID that you have to use to use internet communication. Your browser is like a patient and each patient has a unique card which is like the public key certificate that the doctor issued them which is the trusted authority. The medical card ensure secure communication throughout the hospital, which is like the web server, because everyone has to have a valid ID (certificate) and using a key to move throughout the hospital (confidential exchanges).
### What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
- The main weakness of public PKI is that any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer. So if a CA is compromised it can undermine the entire PKI system and lead to vulnerabilities. 

## Things I want to know more about 
- I think I am just interested in tying this all together with everything else that we have been learning.
