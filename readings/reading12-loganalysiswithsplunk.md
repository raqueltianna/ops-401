### What are three tasks which SOCs often perform? 
 - The three task which SOCs often perform are security monitoring, incident response, and vulnerability management. 
### Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms. 
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) helps organize and handle security information. SOC uses SIEM kind of how parents use Life360. It sends the parent a notification when something is out of the ordinary like their child's phone about to die similar to how SIEM would raise an alert if something was off like a surge in traffic. Which allows the parent (the SOC team) to investigate further and take action. 
## How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk. 
- They have a hierarchical approach. Everything starts at the appropriate response level and then moves up if needed. 
    - Level One: First Response
    - Level Two: Incident Resolution
    - Level Three: Proactive Security Operations
    - Level Four: SOC Performance & Integration with Business.
