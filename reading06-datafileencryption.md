### You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
- Confidentiality: I would make sure that user profiles for employees were set and had the necessary permissions based on need. Someone who was just doing admin work wouldn't have access to client information for example. 
- Integrity: I would implement something like logs or a code that would alert administrators if there was any unauthorized changes or access made to important files. I would also make sure that the company has a good back up plan so that if there was any type of corruption or loss of systems they could still be able to continue business and still have access to those files. 
- Availability: I would make sure that the company has some type of backup plan in place to make sure their is continuous availability if something like a system failed. I would also implement things like firewalls, and other security measures so that attacks like DDos won't affect server availability. 
### Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.
- I'm super into true crime so I would explain that hashing is like how everyone has unique fingerprints. When it's a serious case and they have a suspect whoever has the suspect will receive the fingerprints from the FBI. The fingerprints are then analyzed to make sure that they match just like hashing is like creating a unique fingerprint and if the fingerprints match then the data is intact.  
### How is hashing and encryption different?
- Hashing is like creating a fingerprint while encryption is like putting data into a safe. Hashing is a one way process that produces a fixed size code while encryption is a two way process that transforms data into a coded format.

## Things I want to Know More About:
- I am still actively and will continue to learn about hashing so I'm interested in continuing my learning of it.
