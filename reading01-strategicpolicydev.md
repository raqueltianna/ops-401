### How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?
- I would let them know that pursuing SOC 2 compliance is becoming a standard requirements in the industry and that it can give them a push for getting contracts because a lot of clients would prefer working with a company that emphasizes security. SOC2 compliance will also help identify and address potential security risk, mitigating security issues and the likelihood of breaches. 
### What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?
- Security: The foundational security principle, common to all audits 
- Confidentiality: Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data 
- Availability: Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required. 
- Integrity: Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner. 
- Privacy: The use, collection, retention, didsclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected. 
### How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
- The way I would explain the SOC2 pyramid is that the base of the pyramid, the Policies and Procedures, would be our medical protocols and guidelines. We have standard operating procedures that as medical professionals we have to follow just like an organization's policies and prodecures. The middle layer, the communication and monitoring, would be our vital sign monitoring. We have continous monitoring of vital signs like SPO2, blood pressure, etc. and it is crucial to always monitor those. The second layer of the SOC2 pyramid involves continous monitoring and communication with real time tracking just like vital sign monitoring. The top layer, risk management and continious improvement, are like medical treatment plans. Treatment plans are dynamic and are always changing based on the patient. The top layer is similar because it involves ongoing management and continous improvement.
