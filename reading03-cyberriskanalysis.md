### Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
- Confidentiality: Secure Pin Entry
- Integrity: Transaction logs, keeping logs to track unauthorized or suspicious logs. 
- Availability: regular maintenance on ATM machines and banking apps
### Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
- Separation of duty which prevents power tripping within an organization. It also helps prevent collusion since there is no concrete way to know exactly what every person is capable of. 
- Least privilege which allows users to have only the required access to do their job. Kind of like my military unit, even though there our admin people in our unit they do not have access to the medical records because they don't need to have that to accomplish their jobs. 
- Dual control which requires more than one user to perform a task. Anytime we give narcotics two people have to confirm it is the right patient, right dose, and right medication every time.
### What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stageâ€™s main goal or objective?
- Risk assessment: the main goal of risk assessment is to categorize, classify, and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities. 
- Risk Analysis: the main goal of risk analysis is to assess and analyze through a qualitative and quantitative lens. Key points include asset value, exposure factor, etc. 
- Risk mitigation: the main goal of risk mitigation is reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk.
